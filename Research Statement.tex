The main focus of this project is the affects of admixture on populations of Zea, the genus containing maize.  
Zea is the ideal system for this study not only because corn is one of the most important world food crops \textbf{(citation)}, but also because it is spread over a wide area with many diverse parapatric populations.  
Admixture is especially important in this genus because previous studies suggest some of these adaptions have been conferred to maize via introgression during it's spread across the Americas following domestication in either the Central Plateau of Mexico (CPM) or the Balsas River Valley of Mexico (BRVM) \textbf{(2 citations)}.  
%Admixture can allow locally adapted haplotypes to be transferred between populations by a process of repeated hybridization and natural selection.

%One issue with our current understanding of the evolution of Zea species and subspecies is that it is represented by a phylogenetic tree.  
%Phylogenetic trees, while useful, are often an oversimplification of the relationships between populations which can include migrations between populations, hybridization between individuals and other events which cannot be represented on a traditional phylogenetic tree.  
%By including measures of admixture we can draw a more clear picture of the evolutionary history of maize.
%More specifically we can inform our phylogenetic trees with information about the relationship between maize and locally adapted allopatric wild Zea populations during the post-domestication spread of maize.

I have discovered three populations of Mexican hybrids between lowland \textit{Zea mays ssp. parviglumis} (hereafter parviglumis) and highland \textit{Zea mays ssp. mexicana} (hereafter mexicana) in the CPM and in the northern and southern BRVM.
Although teosinte represents a larger group, for the purposes of this document parviglumis and mexicana in aggregate will be called teosinte.
These teosinte hybrids are believed to be in either modern or ancient hybrid zones.  
Hybrid zones exist on the borders between parapatric populations of closely related species where hybrids are easily formed regardless of whether there is a selective advantage to the hybrid phenotype.
These hybrid populations have never been studied before and could potentially reveal information about the history of maize and teosinte near the 2 proposed regions of domestication in the CNP and the BRVM \textbf{(2 citations)} .

To better understand these hybrids I plan to investigate four questions: 
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item How are these hybrids distributed across Mexico? 
	\item Are these populations stable, locally adapted populations or simply a product of ongoing hybridization between neighboring teosinte?
	\item What is the relationship of these hybrids with each other and their neighboring teosinte?
	\item If these hybrids lie in a true hybrid zone what are the widths of those hybrid zones and how do they compare to the expected widths?
\end{enumerate} 

I plan to use two datasets to answer these questions.  
The first is an existing Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) dataset that has previously been used in three publications \textbf{(3 citations)}.  
This dataset includes 983 SNPs and 2,793 individuals from all species and subspecies of Zea across the Americas as well as some members of the genus Tripsicum.  
%This data will provide me an opportunity to compare these hybrid populations to a broad spectrum of individuals across many regions and taxa.  
%I also believe that using previously published datasets to answer new questions is a great way to take advantage of the growing pool of underused data freely available on internet databases.  
Additionally, I would like to generate Genotyping By Sequencing data (GBS) of hybrid individuals as well as members of nearby teosinte to answer more in-depth questions about the history of these hybrid populations as well as the nature and degree of admixture amongst the hybrid populations and between the hybrid populations and their neighboring teosinte.  
In order to acquire the GBS data I will need to sample in the regions where these hybrids reside, but due to the high crime rates in both BRVM regions and the recent Geurrero student massacre I will only collect samples in the CPM.% and will be therefore required to limit my study of the Balsas River Valley hybrid populations to what I can gather from the SNP dataset.

To identify hybrids, I have analyzed the SNP dataset using the program STRUCTURE.  STRUCTURE provides a q-value matrix representing the percent attribution of an individual to a specified number of groups.  
For the STRUCTURE analysis I used only Mexican samples of maize and teosinte and set the number of groups to 3.
Samples of majority attribution to one teosinte with $\geq$ 25\% attribution to the other are considered to be hybrids.
As these hybrid identifications are based on admixture proportions I plan to confirm them using Reich's F statistic.
These tools will allow me to identify the individuals and therefore roughly determine the range of the hybrid populations.

To answer my second question about the origin and stability of the populations, one measure I plan to use is the relative fitness of the hybrids based on a common garden experiment in the CPM. 
If these populations are stable, locally adapted populations they should not only be present in the intermediate altitude, but also have a fitness advantage in their native range and a disadvantage at higher and lower elevation relative to mexicana and parviglumis respectively.
I would also like to analyze the GBS data for the CPM hybrids with HapMix so I can make a histogram of the lengths of ancestry segments.  
As ancestry segments of a hybrid individual should break up over time due to recombination in the case that this population resulted from one or more hybridization events close in time there should be a peak of ancestry segments near a specific length.
If these hybrids are the result of ongoing hybridization the histogram should look roughly like an exponential decay graph as most ancestry segments would be highly broken up but some would be longer.% indicating many hybridization events including recent events.

To determine the relationship of these hybrids with each other and their ancestors I plan to determine the diversity of these populations using measures of heterozygosity as well as the differentiation of these populations using Wright's Fst.  
Together these will give us a rough idea within and between population relatedness.
I also plan to use the D statistic from \textbf{person's paper (cite)} to determine whether these groups ancestries are sister to either teosinte, ancestral to both or or are true hybrids showing equal clustering with each teosinte.

To build a tree of these hybrids and proximal teosinte populations I will use a new software called Treemix.
Phylogenetic trees, while useful, are often an oversimplification of the relationships between populations.% which can include migrations between populations, hybridization between individuals and other events which cannot be represented on a traditional phylogenetic tree.
Treemix improves on these trees by adding directed and weighted migration edges.% to improve the statistical likelihood of the tree.
Along with a STRUCTURE analysis of these groups and their neighboring teosinte, these analyses should paint a clear picture of the introgression history amongst these hybrid groups including whether their ancestry was originally more parviglumis or mexicana and whether some hybrid populations are derived from others.

Another thing that these data may tell is if there is a cline of attribution to certain teosinte based on the altitudinal gradient and what the width of the hybrid zone is. \textbf{(more hybrid zone talk)}

To successfully complete this project I will require funding for my salary, for GBS and for travel to Mexico.  I will also require the assistance of my major professor Matthew Hufford as well as our collaborators at UC Davis and in Mexico.
A benefit of my work being largely computational and using a previously published dataset is low data generation costs.
To reach out to the greater community I plan to participate in Iowa State University's GK12 program.  Through the program I will be sharing my research with children from the Des Moines public school system.  
I expect that my work will interest these students as Iowa's agriculture is dominated by corn.
The Des Moines public school system is the most diverse in the state of Iowa in terms of representing ethnic minorities.  This program is therefore a great opportunity to get schoolchildren, including underprivileged groups, excited about STEM research.  
I believe that I am uniquely capable of answering these questions because I have experience in programming and computational analyses, experienced advisors and collaborators, a solid academic foundation in genomics and the drive and curiosity to stay focused on the project.
